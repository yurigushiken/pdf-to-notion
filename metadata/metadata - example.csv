Human attitudes towards animals in relation to species similarity to humans: a multivariate approach,Sarah Batt,N/A,free time reading,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yVFNMgaHr4RgLhoG0y7cqmKIYRmr8kpv/view?usp=drivesdk,Human attitudes towards animals are becoming of increasing importance in the areas of conservation and welfare. It has long been taken for granted that our attitudes are influenced by the degree of biological or behavioural similarity between a given species and ourselves. This research investigates whether there is a link between bio-behavioural similarity to humans and preferences for animal species that are obtained when subjects view a set of 40 pictures illustrating a wide diversity of animals.
Anti-anthropomorphism and Its Limits,"Domenica Bruni, Pietro Perconti, Alessio Plebe",2018,free time reading,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yWiZohL0puLfLQpdHpK6Gt9eCHZkKysR/view?usp=drivesdk,"There is a diffuse sentiment that to anthropomorphize is a mild vice that people tend to do easily and pleasingly, but that an adult well educated person should avoid. In this paper it will be provided an elucidation of ""anthropomorphism"" in the field of common sense knowledge, the issue of animal rights, and about the use of humans as a model in the scientific explanation. It will be argued for a ""constructive anthropomorphism,"" i.e., the idea that anthropomorphism is a natural attitude to attribute human psychological features to other individuals, no matter they are actually rational agents, or not. If we know the ""grammar"" of this attitude, we can avoid the risks in overestimating the environmental inputs toward anthropomor-phism and, at the same time, take the heuristic advantages of anthropomor-phism in the use of human mind as a model for both everyday circumstances and scientific enterprise."
Does Endowing a Product with Life Make One Feel More Alive? The Effect of Product Anthropomorphism on Consumer Vitality,"FANGYUAN CHEN, JAIDEEP SENGUPTA, AND RASHMI ADAVAL",unknown,free time reading,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ytAMdGAG88iOiLNN_5-At1hGLI9yKUDS/view?usp=drivesdk,"While most research in the area of product anthropomorphism examines how making products more humanlike can influence subsequent consumer reactions to those products, the present research examines how the act of anthropomorphizing products can influence consumers themselves. We propose that when consumers have an insufficient sense of either connectedness or competence, anthropomorphizing a product satisfies these deficiencies and increases vitality. Furthermore, this enhanced vitality has positive implications for individuals' capacity to exert self-control in unrelated domains. A set of three studies provides support for these hypotheses. By demonstrating the positive effect of anthropomorphism on consumer vitality and self-control, this research illuminates the nature of anthropomorphism. In doing so, we also connect two streams of literature: one on anthropomorphism and the other on vitality, which share an inherent connection that has not been explicated by past research."

Spacing in a simulated undergraduate classroom: Long-term benefits for factual and higher-level learning,"Irina V. Kapler, Tina Weston, Melody Wiseheart",2015,HUDK-4029 Cognition and Learning,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ZRlZMoF2rxMtbr35j0BEP6cPaDD7jrr/view?usp=drivesdk,"Despite showing robust benefits in lab-based research, there remain relatively few studies exploring the spacing effect in educational contexts with meaningful materials. In this study, participants (N = 169 undergraduate students) attended a simulated university lecture where they were presented with natural science curriculum material. Participants reviewed the material either one day or eight days after the lecture via an online review. Participants completed a final test on the material five weeks after each respective review. During the review and final test participants were asked both factual and higher-level (application) questions. Results showed that reviewing material eight days after the lecture led to better final test performance for both types of questions when compared to reviewing only one day after the lecture. This study suggests that spaced review is a robust and effective strategy that can be and should be adapted to classroom practice."
